                <p className="desc-ssk1">One of the primary stages in designing and modeling of an AUV is the study of the motion of the vehicle and the subsequent visualization of fluid flow across the body of the bot.</p>

                <p className="desc-ssk1">Using ANSYS, we can produce 3D flow visualization. Using which we can identify vortex location, find streamlines of velocity across 3D and 2D profiles of the vehicle and find the total drag force on the robot.</p>

                <p className="desc-ssk1">Earlier people had to write a large amount of code ranging 
                from low-level driver functions to high-level control algorithms for their robots. 
                I too experienced this pain when I started working on the underwater vehicle project 
                in my undergraduate university. This approach sometimes made changing even one sensor
                 on our system a daunting task. However, things changed when we started using Robot 
                 Operating System (ROS) as the framework for our robot's software stack. </p>
